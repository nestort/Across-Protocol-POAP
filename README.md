# Across-Protocol-POAP
Across protocol is a novel bridging method that combines UMAâ€™s optimistic oracle, bonded relayers and single-sided liquidity pools to provide decentralized instant transactions from rollup chains to Ethereum mainnet. It promises to be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure L2 -> L1 bridge in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Our community is tasked with building all of the elements of a DAO before the creators turn over full control to the community. Once complete, the protocol will be fully community run and community owned. This POAP will be distributed at an End of year party, where we celebrate the accomplished milestones on the way to forming our DAO.
